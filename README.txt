This is my custom library.

It contains a simple file reader (returns a t_file, defined in the header),
basic string manipulation function, basic memory functions, basic linked lists
functions (there are two list structures, a list head a a list element), basic
hash table functions, a basic garbage collector, and a basic version of printf,
recoded for a school project.

I am in the process of adding dynamic array functions and an error reporting
system.
